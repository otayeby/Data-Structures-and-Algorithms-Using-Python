    A multi-dimensional array consists of a collection of elements
organized into multiple dimensions. Individual elements are re
    -ferenced by specifying an n-tuple or a subscript of multiple
    components, (i_1, i_2, ... , i_n), one for each dimension of th
    -e array.

    In most programming languages, a multi-dimensional array is ac
    -tually created and stored in memory as a one-dimension array.
    With this organization, a multi-dimensional array is simply
    an abstract view of a physical one-dimensional data structure.

    The elements can be stored in row-major order or column-major
    order, and in this MultiArray ADT, we use the row-major order
    storagement.

        Since the size of a multi-dimensional array is fixed at the time it's cr
        -eated and cannot change during execution, the factors(represented as f_1,
        f_2,..., f_i,...,f_n above) will not change either. This can be used to
        our advantage to reduce the number of multiplications required to compute
        the element offsets:
                Instead of computing the factors every time an element is accessed, we
                can compute and store the factors and simply plug them into the equati
                -on when needed.

        Here is another trick, since the equation to compute the factors as follo
        -ws:
        +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                f_n = 1 and f_j = d_j+1 * d_j+2 * ... * d_n-1 * d_n
        +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

        which can be turned into the forms as follows:

        +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                f_n = 1 and f_j = d_j+1 * f_j+1
        +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

        much like a fibonacci equation, so that we can first calculate the f_n and
        cache it, then use the result of f_n to calculate the f_n-1,then f_n-2...
        so on. Everytime we compute the ith factor, the (i+1)th is already known.In
        addition, the sequence of d is given at the moment of initializing, d_1,d_2
        ...,d_i to d_n is also already known.

        It's much efficient than using the first equation.
